# Gesture Recognition

## DEMO

## TODO:
 - [ ] The heat map is a grayscale map that does not require 3 channels, and using one channel to reduce the amount of calculation.
 - [ ] Add a layer of convolution and pooling layer to become AlexNet, the input size does not need to be compressed to 100*100.
 - [ ] Increase data sets and add other categories to improve generalization.
 - [ ] Pay more attention to the precision rate, ignore the recall rate, and remove the results with the closest predictions.
 - [ ] Optimize multiple model loads.

## Reference
Improved on the basis of [Convolutional Pose Machinesm](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) and [HandGestureClassify](https://github.com/yyyerica/HandGestureClassify)
